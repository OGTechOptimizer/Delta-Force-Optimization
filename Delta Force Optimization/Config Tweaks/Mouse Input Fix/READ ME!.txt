An Explanation of What Each Variable Does
-----------------------------------------


1) RawMouseInputEnabled=Enabled
Ensures the game reads mouse movement directly from your hardware without interference from Windows settings (like pointer precision).

2) bEnableMouseSmoothing=False
Disables mouse smoothing, which averages input data over time to make movements feel more "fluid."

3) bViewAccelerationEnabled=False
Disables mouse acceleration, which makes the cursor move faster depending on how quickly you move the mouse.

4) bUseMouseForTouch=True
Allows the mouse to be used as an input method for touch-based interfaces.
